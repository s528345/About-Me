I am in the Computer Science program and i am Junior working on my BA. I have not yet 
found a internship yet.

I am from right here and Maryville, I did a little bit of coding in high school and 
took a couple other computer classes. Mostly my hobbies include video games, sports, 
and just messing around with a computer.

I plan to go and work at cerner and hopefully internship next summer, and eventually 
move to Kansas City.
